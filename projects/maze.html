<h1>Maze</h1>
<p><a href='http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm'>Eller's algorithm</a>
for generating random mazes is great. It is particularly clever in that the
algorithm generates mazes row by row without storing the entire maze in memory.
If your browser supports it you should see a maze and its solution below.  I
generate solutions for the mazes using Dijkstra's algorithm. I implemented both
algorithms in Javascript. Reloading the page will generate a new maze.</p>
