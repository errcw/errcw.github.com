<h1>My Site</h1>
<p>My site, <a href='http://ericw.ca/'>ericw.ca</a>, has had many incarnations
over the years. The first version appeared on the web at the start of 2004, in
my final year of high school. Since then there have been three major revisions
and one minor revision, one every two years or so. My designs have evolved (or
devolved?) but the basic structure and content has remained surprisingly
static. Below is the history of ericw.ca in screenshots.</p>
